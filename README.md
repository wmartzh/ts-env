# ts-env
A typescript enviroment file management tool


## Motivation 
The availability of node can run on different enviroments allow us to use the same codebase for different platforms. However, the different enviroments may have different config files formats. There are some tools like dotenv, dotenv-yaml, to help us load the config files. However, they are not flexible enough to support different config files formats.
